#Mixing dry ingredients

1. In a mixing bowl first take 1 cup whole wheat flour. if the wheat flour is ground in a mill, then do sieve the flour once or twice before using.

2. Add 1 pinch salt. Skip adding salt if using salted butter.

3. Add 3 teaspoons sugar. You can even add 1 to 2 teaspoons sugar or skip it entirely.

4. Add 1 teaspoon baking powder.

5. Add ¼ teaspoon cinnamon powder. You can even add ¼ teaspoon vanilla essence or ½ teaspoon vanilla extract.

6. With a wired whisk mix all the dry ingredients very well. Keep aside.

#Mixing wet ingredients

7. Take 1.5 cups milk in a sauce pan. Keep the pan on a low to medium-low flame and begin to heat milk. You can also use almond milk or soy milk.

8. When the milk is becoming hot do stir occasionally. Do not boil the milk but let it just become hot. You should see some steam coming from the milk.

9. When the milk becomes hot, add 1 tablespoon unsalted butter. You can also use oil instead of butter. Use a neutral flavored oil.

10. Mix the butter in the hot milk very well.


#Mixing wet and dry ingredients:

11. Then add this mixture to the dry ingredients in the bowl.

12. With a wired whisk mix very well.

13. Break lumps with a whisk and make a smooth batter. A few tiny lumps are fine in the batter. The pancake batter is of a pourable consistency and not thick. If the batter looks thick, then you can add ¼ to ⅓ cup more of hot milk. Depending on quality of whole wheat flour more milk can be added.

14. Keep the pancake batter aside.

# Final Making:

15. Then heat a heavy tawa/griddle or pan. spread ½ to 1 teaspoon unsalted butter or oil on the tawa.

16. With a ladle gently pour the batter. Do not spread the batter with the ladle. The batter spreads on its own. You can even use a ¼ to ⅓ measuring cup to pour the pancake batter.

18. On a medium-low flame cook the pancake.

19. Cook the pancake till you see bubbles forming on the surface.

20. When the base becomes crisp and golden, gently turn over pancake.

21. Cook the second side also till golden. Then remove and serve the pancake.

22. You can even stack these eggless pancakes in a casserole or roti basket and then serve warm. Make all pancakes this way. Serve the whole wheat pancakes with fresh fruits or whipped cream or jam. You can also drizzle some maple syrup, honey, caramel syrup or chocolate syrup on these fluffy pancakes.
